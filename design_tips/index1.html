    <h2>01.Minimalist Homepage</h2>
    <p>Keep your homepage minimalistic and free of clutter Your website's homepage should communicate your core message instantaneously. After all, we rarely read every word on a website. Instead, we quickly scan the page, picking out key words, sentences and images. With these known behaviors in mind, it's better to appeal to emotions rather than a word count.</p>
